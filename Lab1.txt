1.	Setup the environment (Visual studio code or code blocks)

2.	Write a program to take a depth in (kilometers) inside the earth as input,
        then compute and print the temperature at this depth in Celsius and Fahrenheit 
            •Celsius = 10 * depth + 20
            •Fahrenheit = 1.8 * Celsius + 32

3.	Write a program that takes the length and width of a rectangular yard and the length and width of rectangular house situated in the yard.
